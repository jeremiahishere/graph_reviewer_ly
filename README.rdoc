Graph Reviewer Ly

Create, share, and organize graphs such as ERDs

===========================
Stuff that is done
- Creating all the models
- Basic devise/cancan system
- Token and permission systems
- Graph and DisplayGraph controllers
- Basic paper.js canvas for the interact page
- Basic collaboration through the node server

===========================
Stuff that needs to be done
- pick a user experience and it is probably missing some features
- user interface is pretty clunky
- need to take a look at id vs display ids for display nodes and display connections on the front end
  - I think there is potential for annoying bugs if they aren't standardized
- missing canvas functionality includes
  - line weights
  - line types
  - auto resize the nodes based on the size of the text
  - include fields in the node display
  - all ajax/node data moving
    - building a list of changes from the user updates
    - saving data to the db from the interact page
- randomize display node locations on create

=============================
Basic user experiences

Creating a graph
- A logged in user has generated a dot file
- Go to the create graph page
- Give the graph a name and paste in the dot file
- It automatically parses the dot files into nodes and connections
- On the show page, the parsed data is shown

Creating a display graph

- Assumes the user has already entered a graph
- Goes to the displaygraph page
- Selects the graph from the dropdown
 - Can only see the graphs that they put into the system
- Gives the display graph a name
- May select public
  - If public, anyone can reach the page without any permissions set
- Presses Submit
- On the show page, it should show all the users who have explicit permissions
  - The user should automatically have full permisisons
  - In the future, other users could also have edit permissions or show permissions (if the display graph is not public)

Adding tables to a display graph

- Assumes the user has created the display graph and has gone back to the display graph index page
- Click on the edit tables link for the display graph
- Uses the partial based javascript fields for adder from dynamic fieldsets fields edit page
  - There is a partial for tables that includes a dropdown for each table
    - Tables that are already on the form are not included in the dropdown unless they are marked for deletion
  - There is a partial for connections with a dropdown with each connection
    - Connections that are on the form or do not have both tables included are not included in the dropdown
    - When a table is removed, the associated connections should be removed as well

Viewing the graph

- The display graph has been created and tables added
- User clicks on the 'interact' (or something less stupid) link to go to the paper page for the graph
- loads a paper canvas with the graph on it
  - nodes are rounded rectangles with the name and fields inside
    - should be automatically sized to fit all the text
  - connections are lines
    - curvy?
    - horizontal/vertical only?
  - clicking and dragging on a node should move it
  - zooming (optional)
    - scrolling the mouse wheel on the canvasshould zoom everything in or out including text size
    - scrolling the mouse wheel on a node should zoom it in or out
    - if we do this, there needs to be another field on display_node called scale
  - pathfinding (super optional)
    - use the boids pathfinding from acts_as_audited_visualizer to automatically organize the graph
    - nodes with connections should group
    - nodes without connections should repel
    - needs to be able to turn on and off
- All this is saved through a nodejs connection that I don't really understand

Sharing the graph

- On each graph page, include two partials
- show graph token link
  - Click on a generate show token button to ajax to the token controller and get a token + url
  - Put the url somewhere easy to copy and paste
  - A user who visits the url before the token expires (24 hours) gets show permissions for the graph 
    - this means they can go to the interact page but not the edit or tables pages
- edit graph token link
  - Click on a generate edit token button to ajax to the token controller and get a token + url
  - Put the url somewhere easy to copy and paste
  - A user who visits the url before the token expires (24 hours) gets edit permissions for the graph 
    - this means they can go to the interact, edit, and tables pages
- these links should only be shown to people who already have the permissions
  - initially, only the display graph creator
- may want to combine the partials and do it all through permissions
  - two forms with two submit buttons, but a single place where the token url is put

Visiting a share link

- Given a link by somebody
- Go to the link
- It adds the correct permission to the correct graph
  - unless the link is expired, then just boots you out to the homepage with an error message
- redirects you to the interact page of the graph

Planned table structure

Backend tables

Graph
- name
- raw_input

Node
- graph_id
- name

Field
- node_id
- name

Connection
- graph_id
- start_node_id
- end_node_id
- start_connection
- end_connection
- line_type
- weight (optional)

Frontend tables

DisplayGraph
- graph_id
- name
- user_id
- public (boolean)

DisplayNode
- display_graph_id
- node_id
- x_pos
- y_pos
- scaling (optional, see mouse wheel section of interact page)

DisplayConnection
- display_graph_id
- connection_id

Permissions tables

User
- standard devise fields

Role
- name
- for cancan roles
- shoud be filled by seeds

RolePermissions
- user_id
- role_id
- user role join table

ShareDisplayToken
- display_graph_id
- token
- expiration_date
- permission_level

UserDisplayGraphPermission
